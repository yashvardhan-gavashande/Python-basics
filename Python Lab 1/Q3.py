# Q3. Write a code that describes Indentation error

""" Indentation Error Explanation
In Python, indentation is very important because it determines the structure and flow of the code. Unlike many other programming languages that use braces {} to define code blocks, Python uses indentation (whitespace) to delimit blocks of code. Each level of indentation must be consistent, and all statements within the same block must be indented the same amount.
